At issue is whether a coalition of energy producers and royalty owners, including Diamond Alternative Energy, can sue over the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2022 decision to grant California’s Clean Air Act waiver. The waiver, reinstated under former President Joe Biden, allows the state to implement stricter vehicle emissions standards to boost the electric vehicle industry. \n",

His body was transferred to the basilica during a procession earlier Wednesday, and was followed by a service led by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who holds the position of “camerlengo” (or chamberlain) tasked with making arrangements for the funeral and conclave in the weeks ahead. Francis’ coffin was laid at the Altar of the Confessio, a sacred space in front of the main tomb of St. Peter, the first pope. Cardinals in the basilica approached to view the coffin in pairs, followed shortly after by the first members of the public who paid their respects. The basilica opened to the public at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Wednesday and will remain open until midnight. On Thursday and Friday, it will open at 7 a.m. and close at midnight.\n",

      "‘Severance’ Creator Says Next Season Of Show Will Solely Be Released As TV Recaps On Vulture.com LOS ANGELES—Saying the new format would help him present the series as he had always intended, Severance creator Dan Erickson announced Monday that the TV show’s next season would be released solely as episode recaps on Vulture.com. “After some debate in the writers’ room, we concluded that 500-word write-ups in New York magazine’s pop culture section were the perfect way to continue unfolding the mystery of Lumon Industries and its severed employees,” said Erickson, admitting that it was a creative risk, but that reading the “outstanding work” already put out by Vulture‘s renowned freelancers as they summarized the show’s earlier seasons gave him confidence this would be a change for the better. “From here on out, every Friday you’ll have to turn to Vulture to get your Severance fix. Trust us here. Once you read a few of these season-three recaps, you’ll realize you won’t miss cinematography, music, lighting, sets, Ben Stiller’s directing, or even actors bringing to life the story of Mark, Gemma, Dylan, Mr. Milchick, and Helly R. All you need is the incredible work of this entertainment news website. Plus, these will have a little unanswered question section at the end, which is always fun.” Erickson added that it was difficult to part ways with Apple TV+, but Vulture had simply made the better offer.\n",

Ants look small, but they are actually super strong and can lift over 50 times their own body weight. Plus, they communicate with pheromones! I know the Catholic Church is in mourning and needs a strong, compassionate leader, blah, blah, blah, but seriously—did you know that ants actually grow their own fungus? They’re tiny little farmers. How cool is that?” Later, after reportedly suffering an unexpected ant bite, God confirmed that the next pope would be selected on the basis of how effectively he could kill insects.\n",

As soon as the medical examiner said ‘hantavirus,’ it was like I physically could not hold the words in my mouth. By the way, did we show you these pictures of the rat nests? Gross, right? See, we can’t stop! We released hours of footage, and I don’t think 10 minutes passed before all these images of their cluttered, messy home were published online with a salacious headline. What a thrill! Hey, want to know what was in the fridge?” At press time, Chavez was reportedly investigating whether or not innocuous security footage of Arakawa grocery shopping the day before she likely died could be spun into evidence that she was a devil-worshipping cannibal.\n",

      "Financial Experts Recommend Diversifying Portfolio With Multiple Harebrained Schemes NEW YORK—Claiming it was the only way to protect one’s assets against economic volatility, a group of financial experts recommended this week that Americans diversify their portfolios with multiple harebrained schemes. “Rather than rely on a single half-baked investment, we strongly encourage people to have several cockamamie business plans to fall back on,” said J.P. Morgan financial advisor Jonathan Rattler, adding that it was important to mitigate risk through a combination of foolhardy ventures like breeding koi fish, stealing copper wire from a scrapyard, and buying a machine on Alibaba that makes lab-grown diamonds. “We suggest investing in a variety of dubious sectors, including miracle hair-growth supplements, alpaca rentals, and using outlets at public libraries to run your own bitcoin farm. Also, we know a guy who makes $2 million a year installing vending machines in local prisons. If you want, we can put you in touch.” Rattler added that Americans planning to retire by age 60 should really consider giving their brother-in-law the $10,000 he requested, because his idea to import exotic ferns was a surefire thing.\n",

The victims, it appears, were drawn in by wild promises about equitable access to wealth, education, and home ownership, but before they knew it, they got played for suckers.” Winthrop added that they haven’t identified the scheme’s kingpin, but are investigating a number of upper-middle class white men who have suspiciously benefitted from the longtime scam.\n",

At issue is whether a coalition of energy producers and royalty owners, including Diamond Alternative Energy, can sue over the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2022 decision to grant California’s Clean Air Act waiver. The waiver, reinstated under former President Joe Biden, allows the state to implement stricter vehicle emissions standards to boost the electric vehicle industry. \",\n",
    "        \"Thousands queue to see Pope Francis’ body ahead of funeral The body of Pope Francis is lying in state in St. Peter’s Basilica, where it will remain for three days until his funeral Saturday, expected to be attended by world leaders including US President Donald Trump. His body was transferred to the basilica during a procession earlier Wednesday, and was followed by a service led by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who holds the position of “camerlengo” (or chamberlain) tasked with making arrangements for the funeral and conclave in the weeks ahead. Francis’ coffin was laid at the Altar of the Confessio, a sacred space in front of the main tomb of St. Peter, the first pope. Cardinals in the basilica approached to view the coffin in pairs, followed shortly after by the first members of the public who paid their respects. The basilica opened to the public at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) Wednesday and will remain open until midnight. On Thursday and Friday, it will open at 7 a.m. and close at midnight.\"\n",

Trust us here. Once you read a few of these season-three recaps, you’ll realize you won’t miss cinematography, music, lighting, sets, Ben Stiller’s directing, or even actors bringing to life the story of Mark, Gemma, Dylan, Mr. Milchick, and Helly R. All you need is the incredible work of this entertainment news website. Plus, these will have a little unanswered question section at the end, which is always fun.” Erickson added that it was difficult to part ways with Apple TV+, but Vulture had simply made the better offer.\",\n",

Nuh-uh-uh, Vermont, no buts about it. Just push through the next few days, and you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about. If you still feel bad after that, try some fish oil. Trust me.

    "        \"God Too Obsessed With Ants Right Now To Focus On Next Pope THE HEAVENS—Admitting that He had barely even noticed the leader of the Catholic Church had died, God, our Lord and Heavenly Father, announced Tuesday that He was too obsessed with ants right now to focus on the next pope. “While I want to commit to finding a successor to Pope Francis, I’m currently in kind of an ant phase right now, and it’s taking up my whole life,” said the Creator of All Things, explaining that ever since He discovered how cool the insects were, He let His duties overseeing the papal conclave fall by the wayside. “Here’s the thing. Ants look small, but they are actually super strong and can lift over 50 times their own body weight. Plus, they communicate with pheromones! I know the Catholic Church is in mourning and needs a strong, compassionate leader, blah, blah, blah, but seriously—did you know that ants actually grow their own fungus? They’re tiny little farmers. How cool is that?” Later, after reportedly suffering an unexpected ant bite, God confirmed that the next pope would be selected on the basis of how effectively he could kill insects.\",\n",

As soon as the medical examiner said ‘hantavirus,’ it was like I physically could not hold the words in my mouth. By the way, did we show you these pictures of the rat nests? Gross, right? See, we can’t stop! We released hours of footage, and I don’t think 10 minutes passed before all these images of their cluttered, messy home were published online with a salacious headline. What a thrill! Hey, want to know what was in the fridge?” At press time, Chavez was reportedly investigating whether or not innocuous security footage of Arakawa grocery shopping the day before she likely died could be spun into evidence that she was a devil-worshipping cannibal.\",\n",
    "        \"Financial Experts Recommend Diversifying Portfolio With Multiple Harebrained Schemes NEW YORK—Claiming it was the only way to protect one’s assets against economic volatility, a group of financial experts recommended this week that Americans diversify their portfolios with multiple harebrained schemes. “Rather than rely on a single half-baked investment, we strongly encourage people to have several cockamamie business plans to fall back on,” said J.P. Morgan financial advisor Jonathan Rattler, adding that it was important to mitigate risk through a combination of foolhardy ventures like breeding koi fish, stealing copper wire from a scrapyard, and buying a machine on Alibaba that makes lab-grown diamonds. “We suggest investing in a variety of dubious sectors, including miracle hair-growth supplements, alpaca rentals, and using outlets at public libraries to run your own bitcoin farm. Also, we know a guy who makes $2 million a year installing vending machines in local prisons. If you want, we can put you in touch.” Rattler added that Americans planning to retire by age 60 should really consider giving their brother-in-law the $10,000 he requested, because his idea to import exotic ferns was a surefire thing.\",\n",

The victims, it appears, were drawn in by wild promises about equitable access to wealth, education, and home ownership, but before they knew it, they got played for suckers.” Winthrop added that they haven’t identified the scheme’s kingpin, but are investigating a number of upper-middle class white men who have suspiciously benefitted from the longtime scam.\",\n",
